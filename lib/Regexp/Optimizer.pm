=head1 NAME

Regexp::Optimizer - optimizes regular expressions

=head1 VERSION

$Id: Optimizer.pm,v 0.21 2013/02/24 05:15:37 dankogai Exp dankogai $

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Regexp::Optimizer;
  my $o  = Regexp::Optimizer->new->optimize(qr/foobar|fooxar|foozap/);
  # $re is now qr/foo(?:[bx]ar|zap)/

=head1 EXPORT

none.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Makes a new optimizer instance.

  my $ro = Regexp::Optimizer->new;

=head2 optimize

Does the optimization.

  my $re = qr/foobar|fooxar|foozap/;
  $re = $ro->optimize($re);

If it is already optimized -- no alteration in the regexp, it is
practically an identity function which simply returns an argument.

If not, it dissasembles the regexp, feeds it to L<Regexp::Assemble>,
and reassembles the result.

=head2 as_string

Same as C<optimize()> but returns a string instead of regexp object.

=head1 CAVEAT

=head2 ??{CODE} used

This module depends on the C<??{CODE}> regexp construct which is still
considered experimental as of Perl 5.16.

=head2 not idempotent

If you feed the regexp that is already optimized, the resulting regexp
may not necessarily the same -- usually you get duplicate C<(?:)>:

    my $re = qr/foobar|fooxar|foozap/;
    $re = $ro->optimize($re); # qr/foo(?:[bx]ar|zap)/
    $re = $ro->optimize($re); # qr/foo(?:(?:[bx]ar|zap))/
